Jiang Bo is a member of the China Society of Image and Graphics, a member of the Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence, and serves as the Vice Chairman of the Shenzhen Computer Society chapter. He obtained his Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science and Technology at the Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen Campus, under the guidance of Professor Lu Guangming. My research focuses on computer vision, particularly deep learning, pattern recognition, behavior recognition, image fusion, and image denoising. Prior to this, I earned my master's and bachelor's degrees from Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, supervised by Professor Song Huaibo. He has been invited to serve as a reviewer for the **IEEE Trans.** series journals and **Elsevier** series journals.
