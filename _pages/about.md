I am currently a Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen Campus, under the guidance of Professor Guangming Lu. Here, my research focuses on computer vision, specifically deep learning, pattern recognition, behavior recognition, image fusion, and image denoising. Prior to this, I obtained my master's and bachelor's degrees from Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, under the supervision of Professor Huaibo Song.
